<h2 id="pl_work"><strong>What is a Personal Loan and How Does It Work?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you get a personal loan, you are formally borrowing money from a lender to fund your personal expenses. You are expected to pay back the money you owe, plus interest and fees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personal loans are also known as unsecured loans because lenders do not require collateral from prospective borrowers. Filipinos typically use personal loans for these purposes:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Getting a personal loan is a straightforward process. In the Philippines, it generally involves these steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li><strong>Comparing personal loans.</strong>&nbsp;Never skip this step because it will help you&nbsp;find the right personal loan&nbsp;for you. Compare different loans offered by banks based on the loan terms, loan amount, interest rates, fees, and repayment amount and terms.</li><li><strong>Personal loan application.</strong>&nbsp;Once you have picked the best personal loan, check if you qualify for the loan. If you do, you can start applying online or at the branch of the bank.

The bank will notify you if your loan is approved.</li><li><strong>The release of loan proceeds.</strong>&nbsp;In the Philippines, banks fund personal loans either by issuing a manager’s check or crediting the loan amount to the borrower’s deposit account.</li><li><strong>Repayment of the loan.</strong>&nbsp;You&nbsp;will pay your monthly installments until the end of the loan term through post-dated checks, automatic debit from your deposit account, or over the counter.</li><li><strong>Loan closure.</strong>&nbsp;When you make your final repayment, your loan will be closed.</li></ol>

<h2 id="pl_advdis"><strong>What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Personal Loans?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like any financial product, personal loans come with benefits and drawbacks, which make them either suitable or unsuitable to certain kinds of borrowers. If you are not sure yet if getting a personal loan is the right decision for you, consider its pros and cons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Pros of a personal loan:</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Lower monthly interest rates than credit cards.</strong>&nbsp;Monthly interest rates on personal loans range from 1.20% to 1.94%, while credit card interest rates go from 2.00% to 3.54%</li><li><strong>Ability to choose a loan repayment period.</strong>&nbsp;If you choose a longer period, your monthly repayments are lower, but you will be charged a higher interest rate.</li><li><strong>Fixed interest rates and monthly repayment amounts.</strong>&nbsp;This helps you manage your finances more easily.</li><li><strong>The borrower’s risk is lower than a secured loan.</strong>&nbsp;Because no collateral is required to take out a personal loan, you will not lose any of your assets.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Cons of a personal loan:</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Higher interest rates than secured loans</strong>&nbsp;(that are guaranteed by collaterals)</li><li><strong>Banks charge a pre-termination fee</strong>&nbsp;when you pay off your loan early.</li><li><strong>There are penalty fees for late repayments.</strong>&nbsp;If not managed well, the unpaid amounts might snowball into a bigger debt.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="pl_interest_rates"><strong>How do Personal Loan Interest Rates Work?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personal loan providers charge an interest on the amount borrowed that must be paid every month.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personal loans have lower interest rates than credit cards, making them a great choice for those who need quick cash for emergencies. But because personal loans are generally unsecured (meaning they are collateral-free), their rates are higher than secured loans such as auto loans and housing loans.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>What is the difference between effective rate and add-on rate?</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Banks that provide personal loans charge two sets of interest rates: monthly add-on rates and effective annual interest rates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The add-on rate is the interest that the lender charges every month on the amount you plan to borrow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, effective interest rates show the actual cost of borrowing money. It includes the administrative or service fees that the bank charges for processing your loan application. This is why the effective interest rate—the one you’ll need to pay—is typically higher than the add-on rate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="loan_fees"><strong>What are Personal Loan Fees?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Personal loan providers charge various fees from a borrower’s loan proceeds. Thus, the amount you will actually receive will be less than the loan amount you have applied for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you apply for a personal loan, find out all the fees that will be taken away from your approved loan amount.&nbsp;Know also the consequences of paying off your loan before maturity or past the due date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

Also known as early payment, installment acceleration, or closure handling fee.</li><li><strong>Late payment penalty.</strong>&nbsp;3% to 8% of your unpaid balances per month. To avoid paying this penalty, make sure you pay your monthly balances on or before the due date.</li><li><strong>Documentary stamp fee.</strong>&nbsp;A tax required by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on loan agreements in the Philippines: Php 1 for every Php 200 in excess of Php 250,000 loan amount (regardless of purpose) or Php 1 for every Php 200 for business loans (regardless of the loan amount).
